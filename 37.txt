1-1 Those lousy traitors! They can't do that to Cap!
1-2 He's a commie fake!
1-3 Let's show 'em they can't do this to real Americans!
Soldier
2-1 Don't worry, Cap! They won't rush the stage! These kind have their dirty work done for them!
Cap
2-2 I almost hope they do try something!
3-1 Listen to me—all of you out there! You were told by this man—your hero—that America is the greatest country in the world!
4-1 He told you that Americans were the greatest people—that America could be refined like silver, could have the impurities hammered out of it, and shine more brightly!
4-2 He went on about how precious America was—how you needed to make sure it remained great!
4-3 And he told you anything was justified to preserve that great treasure, that pearl of great price that is America!
5-1 Well, I say America is nothing! Without its ideals—its commitment to the freedom of all men, America is a piece of trash!
5-2 A nation is nothing! A flag is a piece of cloth!!
6-1 I fought Adolf Hitler not because America was great, but because it was fragile! I knew that liberty could as easily be snuffed out here as in Nazi Germany! As a people, we were no different from them!
6-2 When I returned, I saw that you nearly did turn America into nothing!
6-3 And the only reason you're not less than nothing—
7-1 —is that it's still possible for you too bring freedom back to America!

7-2 There is a long silence, then…
Crowd
7-3 Th-that is him!! That's the real Captain America!
