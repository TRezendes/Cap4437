Page 36 of #WhatIf no.44 - In panel 1, Steve Cap's back is to us, and William Cap looks towards him and us, his shield broken and his eyes wild. In panels 2 & 3, in shades of yellow with dramatic motion lines, Steve wails on William. In panels 4 & 5, William is shaking, stuttering, pleading with Steve, and in panel 6, William collapses face-first, completely done in.

William Burnside Cap:
1-1 All right! You're better than me! You may even be the original—the commies may have dug you up—but you won't destroy America! You won't destroy my country!

Steve Rogers Cap:
2-1 Oh yes I will!!
2-2 Your country isn't America monster, it's Hell! And it's pressed down on America for too long!!
3-1 So swears Captain America!!
4-1 That's it, fight on! I want to tear that costume from your Nazi body!!

Steve:
4-2 You—lousy red—betray everything—

William:
5-1 All my life—loved America—no traitor—seen it run down—spit on the flag—get all of them who—you can't—America needs me!!

Steve:
5-2 Needs you!?
6-1 Only as a reminder, mad-man! Only as a reminder!
