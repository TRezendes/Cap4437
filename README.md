# The Same Three Pages of Captain America Every Day Until Trump Leaves Office

## A Mastodon Bot by [232 Software](https://232.software)

### Without its ideals—its commitment to the freedom of all [people], America is a piece of **TRASH!**

Posting the same three pages of [*WHAT IF? (1977)* #44, *What If…Captain America Were Revived Today?*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/12159/slug) as long as Trump is in office.

I am hesitant to link to Facebook, but I want to give credit where credit is due. This project was inspired by [The Same Panels of Captain America Every Day Until Trump Leaves Office](https://www.facebook.com/captainamericawillsaveus), a Facebook page that never quite lived up to its name. I wish I didn't have the opportunity to pick up the concept and try to do better, but here we are.
