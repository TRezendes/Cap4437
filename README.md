# The Same Three Pages of Captain America Every Day Until Trump Leaves Office

## A Mastodon Bot by [232 Software](https://232.software)

### Without its ideals—its commitment to the freedom of all [people], America is a piece of **TRASH!**

#### About

[@Cap4437​@kind.social](https://kind.social/@Cap4437) Posting the same three pages of [*WHAT IF? (1977)* #44, *What If…Captain America Were Revived Today?*](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/12159/slug) as long as Trump is in office.

I am hesitant to link to Facebook, but I want to give credit where credit is due. This project was inspired by [The Same Panels of Captain America Every Day Until Trump Leaves Office](https://www.facebook.com/captainamericawillsaveus), a Facebook page that never quite lived up to its name. I wish I didn't have the opportunity to pick up the concept and try to do better, but here we are.

The code for this bot is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).

All images are taken from pages 35–37 of *What If?* #44 by writer Peter B. Gillis, penciler Sal Buscema, inker Dave Simons, letterer John Morelli, colorist George Rousos, editor Ralph Macchio, and chief Jim Shooter. Copyright &copy; 1963 Marvel Comics Group & 2018 Marvel

#### Future Improvements

I wanted to have a working version of the bot by the time Inauguration Day rolled around, so it is what it is for the moment, but there are a few improvements I would like to make. Most notably, I want to improve the image alt text, especially on page 37. The alt text character limit is 1500, and just the text on that page comes to 1396 characters, so there wasn't much room for description. A future version of the bot will use versions of the pages that are split between multiple images to provide more room for alt text.
