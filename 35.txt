Page 35 of #WhatIf no.44 - Two Captains America duke it out across seven panels of this comic from April 1, 1984

Steve Rogers Cap:
1-1 Get up! You're just like all the rest! War is peace! Freedom is slavery! Ignorance is strength! Get up so I can knock you down!!

William Burnside Cap:
1-2 You're good, I'll grant you that, Commie!
2-1 But I'm—
    Wha?!!

Steve:
2-2 Too slow by half, imitator!
3-1 Freedom only to those 'worthy' of it—
4-1 —and you decide who's worthy of it! You make me sick!!

William:
5-1 I'll make you more that that, you fake! You'd put freedom in the hands of criminals who would destroy our way of life!!

Steve
5-2 You would destroy everything!
6-1 You're everything I was meant to fight, monster! Your hatred of others, your denial of others humanity, you're a Nazi smear on the American flag!
7-1 And while I live I'll stop you—expose you—vanquish you—destroy you!!

William
7-2 My shield! It's not possible!!
